# Research Learning Log

## Overview
This repository represents my ongoing learning and exploration in clinical research and integrative medicine as a final-year undergraduate student of Naturopathy & Yogic Sciences.

It serves as a structured space to document my understanding of research methodology, literature analysis, and early-stage research thinking, with the long-term goal of contributing meaningfully to academic and clinical research under mentorship.

## Areas of Interest
- Yoga therapy and lifestyle-based interventions in health and disease  
- Integrative approaches to chronic and preventive care  
- Women’s health and metabolic health  
- Community health and public health outcomes  

## Current Academic Focus (2025–2026)
- Building foundational understanding of clinical and translational research  
- Reading, analysing, and summarising peer-reviewed scientific literature  
- Learning to formulate research questions, objectives, and hypotheses  
- Understanding study design, outcomes, and ethical considerations  

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository is intended as a learning log rather than a showcase of completed research. Content will be updated periodically as part of my academic development and preparation for future collaborative research opportunities.

## Note
All content reflects my learning process as an undergraduate student and is subject to refinement as my academic training progresses.
